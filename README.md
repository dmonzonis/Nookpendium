# Nookpendium

-----------------------

Nookpendium is an Android application developed in Kotlin with the main goal of providing Animal Crossing players a one-stop shop for all in-game resource knowledge and tracking.

In it's current state, the app only supports tracking critters for Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Animal Crossing: New Leaf, but it's planned to eventually support all Animal Crossing games with varying levels of information and tracking capabilities tailored to each version of the game.
